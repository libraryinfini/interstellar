			<h2>Effects of Audism</h2>
			<p>Audism is a term used to describe discrimination against deaf and hard of hearing individuals. This can manifest in a variety of ways, such as denying them access to education or employment opportunities, assuming they cannot communicate or understand information, or treating them as though they are inferior to those who can hear. The effects of audism can be profound, leading to feelings of isolation, frustration, and even depression among those who experience it.</p>

			<h2>Recognizing Audism</h2>
			<p>One of the challenges of combating audism is recognizing when it is occurring. This can be especially difficult for individuals who are not deaf or hard of hearing themselves, as they may not be aware of the barriers that exist for this community. However, some signs of audism include assuming that all deaf or hard of hearing people use sign language, speaking loudly or slowly to them, or expecting them to conform to hearing norms (such as not interrupting or speaking too loudly).</p>
